# Text-Summarization
# Overview
This project focuses on text summarization, allowing users to input text and receive a concise summary containing only the key information. Using Python, machine learning, and NLP's Spacy algorithm, the model is designed to efficiently extract and present the most important points from the provided text. The application is deployed via Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for easy access and interaction.

# Features
* Text Summarization: Users input text, and the model summarizes it by extracting the key information.
* Streamlit Interface: Deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing for seamless interaction and summarization.
* Machine Learning & NLP: Built using advanced techniques like the Spacy algorithm to perform text summarization effectively.
  
# Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas for data handling.
* NumPy for numerical operations.
* NLP's Spacy for text processing and summarization.
* Streamlit for web app deployment.
